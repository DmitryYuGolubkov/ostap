# Parallel

* [ostap.parallel](README.md)

Stub for *parallelisation* utilities. Currently it contains 
 - simple `multiprocessing`-based utilites coded by Pere MATO and imported from `GaudiMP`
 - [`pathos`](https://github.com/uqfoundation/pathos)-based variant. 

Unfortunately none of them is perfect and more work is needed in this  area
