ostap project
=============

Nowadays ROOT_/PyROOT_ is de-facto standard tools for performing physics analysis. 
The `ostap` project is a community-driven initiative aiming to provide more user-friendly 
and more intuitive interface to ROOT_/PyROOT_ and RooFit_ and extending the existing functionality.

Project started in 2009 from the private collections of python functions used 
in Kali_ framework for the calibration of LHCb electromagnetic calorimeter. 
A lot of functionality is picked from Bender_ project, 
the python-based physics analysis environment used in LHCb experiment. 
Till Autumn 2016 the project was a part of LHCb software suit and with 
great success has been used for preparation of approximately 30 physics papers. 
A standalone, LHCb independent version, has appeared at start of 2017
