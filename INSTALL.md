Setup
-----

There are several possibilities to start working with Ostap, you can build Ostap on the Linux or lxplus/7 and also run the docker container.  

Linux
-----
Ostap requires the python2 version >2.7 or python3. 
You need to provide ROOTSYS environment for building the library. The library should be built with the same compiler version and C++ standard as was used to build ROOT. 

After setting the enviroments clone  and build Ostap package 

    git clone  git://github.com/OstapHEP/ostap.git
    cd ostap
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<INSTALL_DIRECTORY>
    make -j8
    make install
    source <INSTALL_DIRECTORY>/thisostap.sh 
    
At lxplus/7 you can do it with several LCG  versions  (95,96), using the scripts/setup.sh. Check on which platform is the preferred version of LCG located and run LbLogin, for instance for LCG 95 and  x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt:

    LbLogin -c x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt
    source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_95/${CMTCONFIG}/setup.sh
    source ./scripts/setup.sh
    source LCG_$LCG_VERSION/INSTALL/thisostap.sh


For the latest tag check the page https://github.com/OstapHEP/ostap/releases
To update the package to latest version use following command:

    git pull origin <latest tag>
or to get the head version use:

    git pull origin master

Docker
-----
We also provided Dockerfile to build the OstapHep image.  You can run Ostap interactively using the command line or via Docker Desktop which is available for MacOS and Windows. To create the docker image from the Ostap directory run:

    sudo docker build --network host -t <dockerID>/ostaphep:latest .
Run the image iteractively

    sudo docker  run -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix  -v ${WORKDIR_PATH}/work_dir:/work_dir  -it <dockerID>/ostaphep:latest
To know more about docker, please check the documentation: https://docs.docker.com/.

Ð¡onda
-----
OstapHep is now available on the conda-forge channel https://github.com/conda-forge/ostaphep-feedstock. You can get ostap with conda using the following steps:

Install mininconda

    wget http://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    
Set the conda environments

    source path-to-miniconda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
    
Add the conda-forge to your channels

    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    
Check which versions are available

    conda search ostaphep --channel conda-forge

Create an environment with a specific version of python

    conda create --name ostap-env ostaphep python=3.7

To activate or deactivate the ostap environment use the following command

    conda activate ostap-env 
    conda deactivate  
To get the latest version of the Ostap package:

    conda -n ostap-env install ostaphep=version
The list of available version you can find [here](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ostaphep/files).
To know more about conda-forge, please visit [conda page](https://conda-forge.org).

Additionally you can install the master version of the Ostap package using the dependancy packages which are also availible on the conda:

Set the conda environments

    source path-to-miniconda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
    
Add the conda-forge to your channels

    conda config --add channels conda-forge
Create an environment with a requarement dependancies:

    conda create -n ostap-req-env root_base root-binaries root-dependencies gsl  future configparser  numpy scipy pathos dill multiprocess ppft terminaltables binutils-meta c-compiler compilers cxx-compiler fortran-compiler python ipython cmake

Activate the  environment  with requarement packages:

    conda activate ostap-req-env 

Clone  and build Ostap package:

    git clone  git://github.com/OstapHEP/ostap.git
    cd ostap
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<INSTALL_DIRECTORY>
    make -j8
    make install
    source <INSTALL_DIRECTORY>/thisostap.sh 

Note that the latest command should be used every time when the ostap-req-env are activated again.

SWAN
-----
The Ostap installation using the SWAN CERN service is described  [here](SWAN.md).
