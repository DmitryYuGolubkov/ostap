# v1.4.9.0

## New features 
  1. add new cass `P2Quantile` that interfaces P^2 algortuhm from GSL for running quatile (approximate)
  1. Add methods `Ostap::Statvar::p2quantile`, `Ostap::StatVar::p2quantiles` and  `Ostap::StatVar::p2interval`. These are much faster (but approximate) versions of `Ostap::StatVar::quantile`, `Ostap::StatVar::quantiles` and `Ostap::StatVar::interval`, using P^2 algorithm. 
  1. update `ostap.stat.statvar` for modified `Ostap::StatVar` methods
  1. allow uisng sqlite3 dbase for compresed shelves
  1. extend compressed shelves to keep some metainformation on database (creating/modification date, versions of ostap, ROOT and python versions
  1. add creation/modification date for the items in compressed shelves   
  1. add new test for splot `test_fitting_splot`
  
## Backward incompatible changes
  1. change return type from `Ostap::StatVar::quantile` , `Ostap::StatVar::quantiles` and  `Ostap::StatVar::intrval`  method, adding  also number fo events used for quantile/interval estimation.  It allows to judge abotu the precision  
  
## Bug fixes:
  1. fix really stupid bug in `ValueWithError`
  1. Tiny fix in `Ostap.DataFrame.ProgressBar`
  2. fixed in_range option for the case when fit variables are defined as  RooRealVar
